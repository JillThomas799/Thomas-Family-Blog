            Today the Ikea construction team turned up promptly at 8am to construct her PAX wardrobe, which had arrived the previous day
            in flat pack format. The team consisted of one man with a staple gun and some efficient power tools and within 2 hours the wardrobe was constructed
            and safely attached to the wall as per the pictures below. We have decided IKEA are on to a very good marketing strategy offering this service....

              <br>
              <br>
            Trip to <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/lake-district/acorn-bank" target="_blank" title="Click here to find more about Acorn Bank"><strong>Acorn Bank</strong></a>, which is owned by the National Trust and particularly known for 
            its herbs and fruit orchards.
            It is not usually open before Easter, so we were pleased to discover that the National Trust works closely with the local village of <a href="https://www.visitcumbria.com/evnp/culgaith/"
            target="blank" title="Click here to discover more about Culgaith"><strong>Culgaith</strong></a>, whose residents had asked whether the National Trust would consider opening the property earlier than 
            usual so they could see the snow drops in the grounds, which are very pretty at the moment.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was an excellent opportunity for Elena to sign up for National Trust membership, which once the annual membership is paid, allows her to access
            National Trust properties in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland and also to obtain free parking on the many National Trust car parks in Cumbria, especially in the Lake District National Park.
              <br>
              <br>
              The snow drops were proving quite popular as there were quite a lot of people there. The beds of snow drops were lovely and whilst some areas of the site were
              inaccessible as a result of the recent poor weather eg. the mill was closed off and the more extended walk to the village via the fields was inaccessible due to thick mud,
              otherwise everything was fine. The National Trust had wisely opened the outdoor refreshment stall, and even better had opened the indoor café seating
              area to sit inside out of the cold. Once in the café, Bernard was trying maintain his diet, but kept trying to take some of Elena's gingerbread!

              <br>
              <br>
              It was great today to meet up in Ambleside with some university friends whom we have known for many years. We went on a lovely walk from Ambleside, initially passing
              the memorial of flowers and tributes left to <a href="https://cumbriacrack.com/2024/02/02/fundraiser-launched-to-create-statue-of-beloved-lake-district-cat/" target="blank" title="Click here to read more about Riley"><strong><em>Riley</em></strong></a> 
            , a well-known Ambleside cat who died on the 23rd January 2024 when he was hit by a car. A fund has been set up to create a bronze statue of him. We started off in the centre of town and headed
            initially across the park before picking up the bridle way towards Loughrigg Fell just before Brow Head Farm. Following the climb up around Miller Brow and beyond, we then dropped down the back of Loughrigg
            until we reached the very scenic Loughrigg Tarn, with a superb view of the Langdale Pikes behind.
            <br>
            <br>
            After skirting around the tarn, we took a left turn on meeting the road again to drop down into Skelwith Bridge and a well-earned break at Chester's café, before returning on a small back-road to Ambleside to complete the 9 mile walk.

            <section class = "newsNovember"><strong color="white">Harry bids a fond final farewell to Cardiff <em>(at least for the time being)</em>...apart from of course the final viva...and the PhD ceremony... and any future visits......</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
            Harry is due to finish his PhD on the 31st March 2024 and is now undertaking the final write up of his thesis. For this he will not have to be in Cardiff any longer
            and the tenancy on his flat is coming to an end, so it has been time for a final fond farewell to Cardiff <em>(well,sort of...at least for the time being)</em> and the move 320 miles or so up to the 
            North, not least to reunite with Lennie, who meanwhile in anticipation, has been seriously misbehaving...
<br>
<br>
            The removal company <a href="https://www.intercityremovals.com/" target="blank" title="Click here to discover more about Intercity Removals">Intercity Removals</a> were great and attended promptly to pack everything into the van. We would definitely give them 5* and recommend them.
            The journey up to Cumbria went as well as could be expected given it is a long way on very busy roads. The removal men had had the right idea, in
            breaking the journey overnight such they were at our home in Cumbria just after 9am the following morning!
            <br>
            <br>
            But now is not the time to be sad, as it is the start of a new and exciting era for Harry, as he moves on to his next job ...
            First though it is time for him to have a well-deserved rest after all his hard work and whilst he decides where his future 
            path will lie...
