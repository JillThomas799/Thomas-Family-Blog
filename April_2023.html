                    tiles selected would be OK. The tiling centre had kindly let us take a sample to try out.
                    The only problem with that was trying to get it on site! We have all decided we would make a good construction team
                    and quite enjoyed the hard hats and high-vis jackets.</section>

                Parked at the main village car park and then went for a circular walk of 5 miles to Dunstanburgh Castle owned by English Heritage and round back to Craster village.
                We visited the castle and grounds and saw all the seagulls nesting in the cliffs, much to Harry's delight. </section>

                    through a water pipe and an emergency call to the plumber was necessary to fix it all. However, the end result is great and certainly fit for the purpose intended.

                    went well and the house looks great. Carpets are being fitted next week and hopefully the tiling within the next couple of weeks, at which time
                    it will be the big move up from Droitwich. So a busy time for all the next few weeks but all to a good end.
