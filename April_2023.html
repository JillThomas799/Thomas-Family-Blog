          <p>Visit to Elena's new house to see how everything was progressing. Harry was seeing the house for the first time.
          In the afternoon we went to Abbott's Jersey ice cream farm at Clifton. The photo here is taken in the outdoor seating area 
          overlooking Cross Fell and the Pennine Ridge in the background.
          Following this, we went down the road to Larch Nursery to purchase some alpines for the rockery.</p>

                <section class = "news">Easter Sunday. Went for a visit to Craster village and Dustanburgh Castle. The drive was about 1 hrs 40. 
                Parked at the main village car park and then went for a circular walk of 5 miles to Dunstanburgh Castle owned by English Heritage and round back to Craster village.
                We visited the castle and grounds and saw all the seagulls nesting in the cliffs, much to Harry's delight. </section>
