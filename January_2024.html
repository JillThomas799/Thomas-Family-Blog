                <section class = "newsNovember"><strong color="white">Harry and Bernard return to Penarth, and Jill and Elena have an icy adventure in the Lowther Valley. </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Today it was time for Harry's return to Wales for the final few months of his PhD. Elena and Jill were staying back in Cumbria to look after Lennie, so 
                    the decision was made to drive over to Bampton, a tiny village situated in the Lowther valley between Shap and Haweswater, and to attempt a walk up Knipe Scar.
                    The day did not start well as there was low-lying icy fog. Nonetheless, not to be deterred, Elena and Jill set off in the hope the fog would be lifting by the time
                     we reached our destination of Bampton.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After a proficient piece of driving from Elena, who managed to return the car effectively to its original course when we skidded on some undetected black ice,
                    we arrived in the Lowther Valley to find the mist was still low-lying. What else were we to do, but retire to Lowther café for drinks and cakes? 
                    We thought it would be quiet, but it seemed that many people had had the same idea! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we left the café to once again try our luck down in the valley for the walk, what should we see but a <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/optical-effects/rainbows/fogbow" target="_blank" title="Click here to learn more about what a fogbow is"><strong>fogbow</strong></a> which, as this link
                    to  the met office site explains, is similar in some respects to a traditional rainbow forming from sunlight interacting with water droplets contained in fog, mist or cloud rather than interacting with raindrops as it does in a classical rainbow.We had never seen a fogbow before,
                    and it was quite spectacular.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We departed Lowther Castle and headed down the Lowther valley but then a very strange noise started to emanate from the brakes! It sounded as it one/ multiple of the brake pads
                    might be rubbing.The lane was more or less single track with nowhere to stop, so we had no choice but to drive the 5 miles into Bampton where we could find parking.
                    On arrival at the car park, there was no possibility of phoning for assistance as there was no mobile signal, and the fog was even thicker so no walk...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The decision was made to return to Elena's at Penrith and walk into Penrith town, which we did, returning home later in the day only to find...the fog was even thicker at home.
                    So we can successfully say it was a thwarted trip, but with some spectacular scenery and the all-important café stop en route.

                    Action is fully underway now for Harry's forthcoming termination of his PhD and move back to Cumbria. It has been agreed that there is <em>no way</em> that
                    we are undertaking the move ourselves this time, so being 'professional' house-movers now, we are recruiting a removal company to help us with the removal...

                    The date has been confirmed today as Thursday and Friday the 15th and 16th February respectively, the deposit has been paid and it is just a matter now of clearing 
                    some space in the garage.... actually, this was not as bad as it sounds as it gives us an excuse to have a further clear out. For those who saw the state of our 
                    garage when we initially moved in 3 years ago with 3 houses worth of clutter...<em>do not panic</em> , this has long ago been sorted and triaged. However,
                    we work hard these days to keep it under control, so we have been busy donating some unwanted items to British Heart foundation charity, who are coming to collect them 
                    on Wednesday this week.

                    It was interesting today to discover that even on one of the most wet and miserable of winter days, there are still some delights... We decided to gain shelter from the rain by going to a café we had been meaning to try out for ages, namely

                    John Watt & Son, is an independent Carlisle coffee roasters and tea blenders business which was established as long ago as 1865. They have several small cafés within the city including the
                    one we were visiting today on Bank Street, but also the popular Coffee and Ales café at Bookends bookshop, the Roastery on Blackfriar's Street and the café at the Military Museum in Carlisle Castle (which is also well worth a visit). 
                    In addition to their on-site presence in these cafés you can also order their coffees and teas online at their  <a href="https://johnwattcoffeeandtea.com/" title="Click here to find out more about John Watt and son Coffee roasters and tea blenders " target="blank"><strong>online shop</strong></a>.

                <section class = "newsNovember"><strong color="white">Trip to <em>(..our not so favourite store..)</em> Ikea</strong>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We took a deep breath today and prepared ourselves for a necessary visit to our not so favourite store....Ikea, to go to view erected in real life,
                    the<em> (admittedly very popular)</em> PAX wardrobe system, which Elena was considering as a storage solution alternative for her spare room. 
                   Bernard was invited along too but <em>(..rather conveniently we thought...)</em>  said he had other, more pressing things to do at home...!! Though we could not quite work out what these things were...
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   We had formulated a (<em>seemingly</em>) fool-proof plan. Ikea is always extremely busy and this only gets worse as the day goes on. However, the store actually opens 1 hour before its stated opening hours on a Sunday (ie. 10am rather than 11am). The first hour however is for browsing only
                   as the tills only open at 11am. Therefore, given that we were only looking rather than buying, it was decided to get up early to be there for just after 10am when it was quiet.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                All was going perfectly to plan until Ikea's marketing strategy of persuading you to buy things which you did not go for and never needed, but suddenly appear essential came into play. We found an item we needed to buy 
                and as a result would have to wait until 11am to go through the tills. So, what were we to do but decamp to the Ikea café for drinks ...? It was many years since we had subjected ourselves to the Ikea 
                café  experience, which appeared almost ritualistic in its format. However at £1.50 per drink on a Sunday, it was too good an opportunity to miss and it was great to have a sit down and a rest...
                <br />
                <br />
                The good news was, the trip turned out to be worthwhile as a few days later Elena ordered her wardrobe system.
                <br />
                <br />

                    <section class = "newsNovember" style = "border: none;"><strong>Visit to the Borrowdale Valley: Walk Castle Crag and the Jaws of Borrowdale</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Castle Crag and Borrowdale walk is a popular, scenic five and a half mile walk starting from either Rosthwaite or Seatoller, climbing up on to the fellside above Seatoller and joining the bridleway 
                        over to Castle Crag, with the option to ascend Castle Crag itself, for those who so wish. There is then a descent back down to the River Derwent and the return journey back along the River Derwent.  Whilst not a difficult walk, there
                        are some occasional tricky sections eg.a traverse of some very slippy tree roots along the river bank just outside Rosthwaite, the rocky scramble (for which there are now some metal chains to provide additional support) between Glaramara Youth Hostel and Seatoller and the stony descent down through Low How wood.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We chose to start the walk at Rosthwaite National Trust Car Park, turning right out of the car park and past Yew Tree Farm, where we stayed at Easter in 2012. There are some stepping stones over the river,
                        but following the recent heavy rain, these were impassable. There is however the back up option of crossing the river via New bridge.
                        Then it was a left turn and we picked up the path along the river Derwent via Folly Bridge and towards Seatoller. After carefully negotiating a section of very slippy tree  routes and the rocky scramble 
                        just the other side of the Borrowdale Youth Hostel, we arrived in Seatoller.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        According to the guidebook, most of the houses in Seatoller are 17th century and were built for workers in the nearby Honister Pass and plumbago mines.
                        Once out of the village, we took the road upwards towards the Honister Pass and then up onto the path up the lower slopes of Dale Head, passing a very placid pony (who seemed used to having its photo taken with visitors!)
                        Further on we joined the Cumbria Way bridleway leading over towards Castle Crag, the smallest of the Lakeland Fells. All was going well until it wasn't.....and we discovered our route was impassable, due to a large tree
                        which had fallen across the wooden bridge across Tongue Gill in the recent storm and destroyed it. A back up plan was quickly formulated, and we managed to traverse Tongue Gill by fording it just up stream.
                        So all smiles again...
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We continued along the Cumbria Way, heading towards Castle Crag and King's How, which together comprise the<em> 'Jaws of Borrowdale'</em>, before grabbing some lunch prior to our stony descent through High How's and Low How's Wood to the shores of the River Derwent.
                        It was a straightforward walk then back towards Rosthwaite. Unfortunately, the tea room at Yew Tree farm was not open, but no worries, we had brought our 
                        own supply of goodies and Elena brought out the home-made blueberry muffins she had baked the previous evening...
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Overall, an enjoyable walking in a very beautiful are of England which as luck would have it , was not too busy.
