      <section class = "newsNovember"><strong color="white">Trip to Carlisle on the train with Elena to go shopping and see the Christmas Market</strong> 
          <br><br>
      It was the first weekend of the Christmas market in Carlisle today, so it was agreed we should catch the train into the city centre to do some shopping, visit the famous
      <a href="https://www.bookscumbria.com/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Bookends bookshop"><strong>Bookends</strong></a> book shop, try out the popular <a href="https://carlislecathedral.org.uk/cafe/"
      target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Carlisle Cathedral café"><strong>Carlisle Cathedral café</strong></a> and then return home later in the afternoon.
      <br>
      <br>
      It was snowing as we walked to the station and the cows in the field looked very cold. The station was deserted today, however when the train arrived it was busy, with a number
      of people wearing santa and reindeer antler hats. Quite a few people looked like they were going into see the Christmas market and some others were obviously traveling further afield.
      Everyone seemed in good spirits.
      <br>
      <br>
      The bookshop had the new novel by Adrian Goldsworthy <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-City-Victory-Book-ebook/dp/B0B2GHFDLG/ref=sr_1_11?crid=3B77RYJ5NVM23&keywords=adrian+goldsworthy&qid=1701635499&sprefix=adrian+goldsworthy%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-11" target="_blank"><strong>The Wall</strong></a>, which Jill bought. Carlisle Cathedral Café was very busy but had a good, reasonably-priced menu (see photo). There was also turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich as sandwich of the day, which Elena chose.
      Afterwards, it was time to visit the Christmas market, including looking at the German sausage stall, bringing back memories of our time living in Germany 5 years ago now.
      <br>
      <br>
      Later, after returning home, it was time to put the christmas tree and decorations up in the living room. Needless to say Lennie the cat was not overly impressed with the tree...

      <section class = "newsNovember"><strong color="white">Trip to Keswick for the day</strong> 
          <br><br>
      Decided to go to Keswick for the day today, as the weather forecast was better than for the following few days. Keswick is always a good outing with some lovely walking for all skill levels and great
      shops and places to eat. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We parked up past the football ground and walked into town  alongside the park. It was very busy as the Christmas market was on all day. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We had a lovely walk out to Friar's Crag and down the left side of Derwentwater, heading towards Walla Crag. Tha National Trust have done a lot of work improving
      all these footpaths. It was relatively quiet on the walk, as most people seemed to be in town shopping, rather than walking down the lake. There were some very atmospheric views down the lake, 
      looking into the stormy weather. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Soon however, the weather took a turn for the worse, and it was time to return to town and go to see the Christmas markets.

          Today was the long-awaited Christmas day and everything seemed to be reasonably under control...Bernard had put a lot of work over the preceeding weeks
