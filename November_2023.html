                    Welcome to the new Winter-look blog for November. The colours are taken from an autumnal russet pallet in hex color coding. The display for 
                    this month is a firework display using SASS (Syntatically awesome style sheets for those with computer know-know, a presursor of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)). Apologies for the delay in getting this uploaded
                    but it took some time to work out how to add and use live SASS compiler in VS code!!. All those professional software engineers and experts
                    are allowed to raised their eyes to the ceiling in a long-suffering manner at this point....... Anyway, hope you enjoy the new look anyway. All feedback and suggestions for improvement welcomed.

                    <strong>Wednesday, 1st November: Day 3 - Visit to Audley End House and Gardens, Saffron Walden, Essex</strong><br><br>
                        Audley End House and Gardens are under the care of English Heritage and the house was one of the largest and most opulent houses in Jacobean England. The grounds were designed by Capability Brown, though not without disagreements, as the information boards point out. The parterre and organic kitchen gardens have been restored.

                    <strong>Thursday, 2nd November: Day 4 - Trip to London to visit the National Gallery and to go to see English National Opera at the London Coliseum</strong><br><br>
                    A busy day today as it was off to London on the train to see the National Gallery and to go and see <a href ="https://www.eno.org/whats-on/la-traviata/" target = "_blank" title = "Click here to discover more about English National Opera's 'La Traviata' "><i>La Traviata</i></a> performed by the English National Opera at the London Colisseum. 
                    <br><br>
                    First, it was to the train station to catch the train into London. Then on to the National Gallery, which was extremely busy as it was half term week holiday for some of the schools. It was 
                    a good opportunity to see Turner's painting <i>'The Fighting Temeraire'</i> which is housed at the gallery, amongst many other well-known paintings. We appeared to be not the only ones to find the 
                    gallery very large and busy as we met another gentleman asking us if we knew the way out as he had been wandering around some time trying to find it!
                    <br><br>
                    Then it was onto our pre-theatre dinner at <a href = "https://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/london/covent-garden#/" target = "_blank" title = "Click here to find out more about Brown's at Covent Garden">Brown's Covent Garden</a>
                    before going on to the performance, which was very good.

                We now both qualify for senior railcards (isn't that an awful thought.....). However, there is a far more positive side, as after paying a small sum of money,
                we are now the proud owners of 2 senior railcards which entitle us to a third off the price of many, many rail fares. To try this out, we walked 23 minutes through the countryside to our local station
                and took the train into Carlisle. It is a scenic ride and all went very well. Plans for future trips include Newcastle, Hexham, Gretna, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Morpeth, Leeds, London and Durham and lots more.
                Also with the walks to and from the station each way, lots of exercise and cheaper and more eco-concious than taking the car!
