                    Welcome to the new Winter-look blog for November. The colours are taken from an autumnal russet pallet in hex color coding. The display for 
                    this month is a firework display using SASS (Syntatically awesome style sheets for those with computer know-know, a presursor of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)). Apologies for the delay in getting this uploaded
                    but it took some time to work out how to add and use live SASS compiler in VS code!!. All those professional software engineers and experts
                    are allowed to raised their eyes to the ceiling in a long-suffering manner at this point....... Anyway, hope you enjoy the new look anyway. All feedback and suggestions for improvement welcomed.

                    <strong>Wednesday, 1st November: Day 3 - Visit to Audley End House and Gardens, Saffron Walden, Essex</strong><br><br>
                        Audley End House and Gardens are under the care of English Heritage and the house was one of the largest and most opulent houses in Jacobean England. The grounds were designed by Capability Brown, though not without disagreements, as the information boards point out. The parterre and organic kitchen gardens have been restored.

                    <strong>Thursday, 2nd November: Day 4 - Trip to London to visit the National Gallery and to go to see English National Opera at the London Coliseum</strong><br><br>
                    A busy day today as it was off to London on the train to see the National Gallery and to go and see <a href ="https://www.eno.org/whats-on/la-traviata/" target = "_blank" title = "Click here to discover more about English National Opera's 'La Traviata'" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">La Traviata</a> performed by the English National Opera at the London Colisseum. 
                    <br><br>
                    First, it was to the train station to catch the train into London. Then on to the National Gallery, which was extremely busy as it was half term week holiday for some of the schools. It was 
                    a good opportunity to see Turner's painting <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-the-fighting-temeraire" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about the painting" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold"><em>'The Fighting Temeraire'</em></a> which is housed at the gallery, amongst many other well-known paintings. We appeared to be not the only ones to find the 
                    gallery very large and busy as we met another gentleman asking us if we knew the way out as he had been wandering around some time trying to find it!
                    <br><br>
                    Then it was onto our pre-theatre dinner at <a href = "https://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/london/covent-garden#/" target = "_blank" title = "Click here to find out more about Brown's at Covent Garden"  style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">Brown's Covent Garden</a>
                    before going on to the performance, which was very good.

                We now both qualify for senior railcards (isn't that an awful thought.....). However, there is a far more positive side, as after paying a small sum of money,
                we are now the proud owners of 2 senior railcards which entitle us to a third off the price of many, many rail fares. To try this out, we walked 23 minutes through the countryside to our local station
                and took the train into Carlisle. It is a scenic ride and all went very well. Plans for future trips include Newcastle, Hexham, Gretna, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Morpeth, Leeds, London and Durham and lots more.
                Also with the walks to and from the station each way, lots of exercise and cheaper and more eco-concious than taking the car!

               Ben Robinson, the archeologist presenter, explains how in the early 1800s Port Carlisle, as a result of the industrial revolution,  was hoping to be a competitor for great northern port cities such as Liverpool and in 1819, work was started on a wide and 
               9 feet deep canal, which could carry ships up to 120 tonnes between Carlisle and the Solway Firth.
               <br><br>
               Prior to 1800, the location was known as Fisher's Cross and there had been very few houses. The building of the canal however, led to the rapid expansion of the village. Today, the main street is made up terraces of these 
               prestigious houses dating from the period of the 1810s, 20s and 30s and built for people who had money.   Features of late Georgian architecture can still be seen on many of the houses. One of these houses was owned by one of 
               Port Carlisle's shipping magnates.
               <br><br>
               The remains of the large harbour construction, are still clearly visible out into the water.This harbour construction can be seen to lead into the start of what was then the Carlisle Ship Canal.
               The investors for the development were the businessmen of Carlisle. By building the canal from Port Carlisle they could take goods, especially coal which was much in demand for the industrial revolution,straight into 
               Carlisle and export them to the continent more cheaply. It cost £80,0000 (nearly 10 million pounds in today's money). The canal not only brought trade but also passengers wanting to escape the industrial northern towns and cities, leading to development 
               in the village to cater for these visitors such as the Solway Hotel and a private bath house (now a private residence).
               <br><br>
               The canal took 3 years to build and opened in 1823. By 1845 Port Carlisle appeared on the surface to be thriving, with the canal busy and tourists bringing in additional money but things were very soon to change with the arrival of the railways. Trains 
               could carry more cargo and were much quicker, reducing the time of transit from Carlisle to Port Carlisle from 1 hour 45 minutes to 35 minutes. In 1853, 30 years after it was first opened and despite the initial cost of the build, the canal was drained to make way for a rail track
               in its bed and in 1854 the railway line opened. 
               <br><br>
               However, this railway line also did not last for long as by 1859, the Burghers of Carlisle were interested in developing a new port 8 or 9 miles down the coast at Silloth.The railway down from Carlisle to Silloth opened in 1856. The steam railway from Carlisle 
               to Port Carlisle therefore lasted only 3 years. However, the rail track at Port Carlisle was developed into having a unique use, being the track for a horse-drawn dandy car from Port Carlisle to Drumburgh which people could travel on. Eventually though, Port Carlisle's growth 
               faded and today the village with all the historic reminders remains.

                      The plan had been to go to Newcastle on the train today but it was pouring with rain, so persuaded Bernard to a trip to the Gateshead Metrocentre (he is not a great fan thereof). It was quite busy as 
                      people were doing their Christmas shopping, but it was an enjoyable trip. Even Bernard said that the Metrocentre was not too bad, so there is hope yet for further trips there....
                      <br><br>
                      By the time we returned home, it had stopped raining, so there was still time for a walk round the tarn. There, we saw a giant cormorant drying its wings (see photo below). Apparently, cormorants cannot make their wings waterproof like ducks, 
                      so when they have finished fishing, they dry themselves by sitting facing the sun and drying their wings....

                <section class = "newsNovember"><strong>Trip to Newcastle on the train:</strong><br><br>
                      Today was our 2nd attempt at a trip to Newcastle on the train (the 1st had to be called off due to bad weather). So it was up early and a mile to walk to the station in order to catch the train arriving in Newcastle city centre for around 10am.
                      It is in large part a very picturesque ride along from Carlisle to Newcastle as it follows close to the path of Hadrian's wall before stopping off at, amongst other places, Hexham and Gateshead Metro centre and finally crossing the river Tyne to
                      arrive in Newcastle Central Station. 
                      <br><br>
                      On leaving Newcastle Central Station and crossing the road, in the pedestrian zone of Grainger Street, are the 3 statues (<i>'Standing Man', 'Walking Man' and 'Floating Man'</i>) by the sculptor <a href="https://www.seanhenry.com/contact/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Sean Henry and his sculptures" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">Sean Henry</a>, collectively known as <i>'Man with Potential Selves'</i>
                      and depicting aspects of an everyday working man from Newcastle. At the top of Grainger Street and Gray Street is <a href="https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/greys-monument/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Grey's Monument" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">Grey's Monument</a> built in 1838. Then it was on to my favourite Newcastle bookshop,
                      the university bookshop <a href="https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/home" target="_blank" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">Blackwell's</a> , before a much needed café stop and continuing shopping. Lunch was in John Lewis and was actually really good,
                      before it was time for a walk down my favourite street, Grey Street, and then down Dean Street to Quayside.
                      <br><br>
                      A short walk along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quayside" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Quayside" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">Quayside</a>  and then it was time to wander back past <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/campaigns/visit/bessie-surtees-house/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Bessie Surtree and her house" style="color:#ffd200; font-weight:bold">Bessie Surtee's House</a>, which is a Jacobean merchant House best known as the scene of the elopement of Bessie Surtree with John Scott, later Lord Chancellor of England.Then on to the station to catch the train home and the walk back to the village. In all we
                      walked 7 miles in total!

                    <br><br>
                    There had been a period of high pressure for several days and the skies were blue, albeit very icy and with a light dusting of snow. Undeterred despite the cold, we put on our snow boots, snow gear and
                    set off promptly to go hiking over the back of Talkin Fell to Forest Head, saying 'hello' to about 10 deer we saw en route, and then dropping down into Hallbankgate for lunch at the <a href="https://hallbankgatehub.org/" target="_blank" title="Click here to

                    The Hub developed in 2016 out of the threatened closure of the local Coop in the village, when the community came together to purchase the shop 
                    and run it themselves. It is popular with locals, cyclists and visitors to Hadrian's Wall amongst others and staffed by paid staff and volunteers.We had a beautiful lunch of homemade soup and bread before continuing in light snow
                    to complete the remainder of the walk. There is also a good and popular pub in Hallbankgate village <a href="https://belted-will.inn.fan/" target="_blank" title="Click here to
