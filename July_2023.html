            Called in at Lowther Castle to see the Rose garden in bloom. It was really impressive and very pretty. The garden and landscaping team have made a very good job of it.

            <br>
            <br>
            Today we visited the Leighton Moss <a href = "https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/leighton-moss/" title="Click on this link to discover more about the RSPB Leighton Moss Reserve" target="blank_">RSPB reserve at Silverdale</a> with friends, who the day before had been on the Scarborough Spa steam train express from Carnforth
            to Scarborough to celebrate a 60th birthday. The weather was fine and the reserve was very busy with a large, enthusiastic volunteer group who we first came across on arriving at the car park. 
            The food at the cafe, both for morning coffee and lunch were very good. Birds seen today included a Marsh Harrier, ducks, moorhens,
             widgeons and a heron, amongst others. We walked almost all around the reserve. On the return journey we called at Penrith to help Elena to erect the garden storage unit.

            <br>
            <br>
            Today visited Gateshead Metro Centre with Elena to look for some cushions for her house amongst other things. Also to collect some 
            click and collect items from Ikea which Elena had ordered. Unfortunately there had been a misunderstanding as to the collection point location
            which is no longer at the Metro Centre but at the Follingsby Park IKEA collection, Gateshead so we had a very interesting 20 mile detour! However, end result was 
            that the items were successfully collected so we were all happy.

      <section class = "news"><strong color="white">Visit to Cragside House and Gardens (National Trust), Rothbury, Northumberland.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Drove over to <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/north-east/cragside" title ="Click here to discover more about Cragside House, Rothbury, Northumberland" target="blank_">Cragside House and Gardens (National Trust)</a> 
        via the A69 and B6318 along Hadrian's wall past "Once Brewed", "Vindolanda" and "Housesteads" and then on, with views of the Cheviot Hills through Wallington over to Rothbury. The journey took around 1 hour 45 but it was 
        a sunny, quite warm day and the scenery was beautiful and very wild. At one point, on a very quiet country lane, we saw a heron just standing in the middle of the road refusing to move.The weather was reasonably good and sunny. 
        Cragside, which is owned by the National Trust, was itself very busy.It was the home of William Armstrong (1810-1900), the engineer and industrialist who founded the Armstrong Whitworth manufacturing concern on Tyneside. 
        He designed the hydraulic engines used to power the Swing Bridge in Newcastle which was completed in 1876. Cragside was the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity. There was a water-powered spit roast in the ktchen.
        <br>
        <br>
        We chose to visit the gardens and grounds but not inside the house itself.The property and grounds extend a significant distance up the hillside so on a repeat visit, together with the interior of the house,
        it would be good to explore some of the outer areas of the grounds up the hillside. Favourites from this visit were the Pump House and Archimedes screw and the sheer size and impressiveness of the house and grounds.
        It was interesting to imagine what the views would have been like during Armstrong's time as the many rhodedendrons and trees are now quite large and presumably due to the period between Armstrong's death and the grounds
        coming under the care of the National Trust when maintenance may not have been able to be as intense, much of the estate can feel a little enclosed.

        <br>
        <br>
        Had an enjoyable day in Keswick meeting up with old friends from Ormskirk whom we had not seen for about 18 months. The weather was not great 
        but we took the time to go for morning coffees and cakes at a small cafe opposite the Moot Hall in Keswick followed by a very pleasant walk over Friar's Crag 
        and along the shore of Derwentwater via Strandshag bay as far as Calfclose Bay, then cutting back along the footpath close to the road back into Keswick. 
        We then had lunch at <a href="https://hopeleisure.com/cafe-hope/" title="Click here to find out more about Café Hope">Café Hope</a> at Hope Park. The lunch was great, reasonably priced for Keswick, large helpings, 
        interesting and a little different menu selections and friendly staff. Will go again.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was great to meet up again and catch up on news and what has been happening, together with a pleasant walk.

            <br>
            <br>
            It was raining for most of the day today so it was decided to have a visit to Carlisle and to visit <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/carlisle-castle/"
title="Click here to find more about Carlisle Castle" target="blank_">Carlisle Castle</a> as it was some years since we had last visited. It was interesting and atmospheric to once again walk around the Castle
on a rainy, windswept day which helped bring to life the castle's changing history as a fortress, a residence and a military training centre, including a time during the Jacobite rebellion
when it was used to house prisoners awaiting trial. The original castle was built in 1092 but late replaced by the stone structure and today is owned and run by English Heritage. Favourite parts of the visit were seeing the third century roman altar which Had
been used as a door lintel in the buildings of the outer gatehouse and also the carvings in the wall of the keep from the 15th century including the Boar, badge of Richard III.
Since our last visit, there had also been a museum of military life added which was actually quite interesting and reasonably balanced in information reporting. 
<br>
<br>
In the evening it was a home-cooked celebration dinner.

Went to <a href="https://www.scotbycycles.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scotby cycles</a> in Carlisle today to explore purchasing a towball mounted cycle carrier

and just need to get a tow bar and approved additional number plate for the rear of the car now and then we are all set, so quite exciting.
<br>
<br>
We then went on to Dobbie's for lunch and to look around the garden centre and in the afternoon went for a pleasant walk along the river Caldew around the vicinity 
of Dalston village (including seeing 2 goosanders) .

                <br>
                <br>
            Elena was staying so we all decided to visit the National Trust's Wallington House and Gardens, Cambo, near Morpeth in Northumberland as we had noticed it when driving back from Cragside the other week and had thought that it looked 
            worth a visit. It was much bigger than it appeared from the road and was a very enjoyable visit. There is a lovely 2-2.5 mile walk from the gardens down to the river, across some stepping stones and then along river bank before returning into the main gardens.

            Together with our activities discussed above, there was also plenty of opportunity for lots of local walks most days. 
            There have been the ducklings on the lake again and also some incredibly cute moorhen chicks. The construction of the star-gazing pavilion at Talkin Tarn is now complete.
            <br>
            <br>
            Web development skills have also progressed. Learning about gradients in CSS has enabled the addition of the sunny picture at the top of this July blog page this month.
