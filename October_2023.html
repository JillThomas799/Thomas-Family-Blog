                        <strong>Monday, 30th October: Day 1 - From home to Market Bosworth, Warwickshire  Overnight stay in Market Bosworth.</strong><br><br>
                        The journey to Essex is long, so it was decided to break the journey midway in Market Bosworth in Warwickshire, where we had lived for a time many years ago.  This meant we could take the longer route via Alston and Middleton-in-Teesdale on the B6277, which is a very atmospheric drive (if you like wild countryside, that is) before joining the A1 at Scotch Corner.
                        We were staying the night at <a href = "https://www.bandbno3.co.uk/" target = "blank" title = "Click here to discover more about B&B No.3 at Market Bosworth">B&B at No.3</a>, Market Bosworth which is a lovely B and B in a Georgian-fronted building in the town centre and had booked an evening meal

                        <strong>Tuesday, 31st October: Day 2 - Breakfast in B and B in Market Bosworth, visit to Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre, drive to Essex.</strong><br><br>
                            After breakfast, it was time to review the weather (wetter than forecast...), put on our waterproofs, and head off on the 6 mile round walk via Sutton Cheney to the Battle of 
                            Bosworth Heritage Centre.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The route we were taking was through the bottom of the park in Market Bosworth on to the bridleway, which was a favourite route many years ago. However,
                            before long we realised we had taken the wrong track and with the assistance of a very kind local resident were able to discover that in the early 2000s a large number of new trees had been planted on the south side 
                            of the park which had now grown, so it looks quite different and less open now. It was impressively muddy after the rain and also it is very easy to get lost on these country footpaths, especially when misty (things I did remember from previously)! However, eventually we arrived safely 
                            and went in to view the heritage centre.
                            <br><br>
                            For those who are a little rusty with their history, the Battle of Bosworth took place on a field near to Market Bosworth in Warwickshire during the Wars of the Roses on the 22nd August 1485 
                            between the House of York, led by Richard III, and the House of Lancaster, led by Henry Tudor (soon to become Henry VII). In spite of their lesser numbers, the Lancastrians won and Richard III was killed.

                        <strong>Wednesday, 1st November: Day 3 - Visit to Audley End House and Gardens, Saffron Walden, Essex</strong><br><br>
                            Audley End House and Gardens are under the care of English Heritage and the house was one of the largest and most opulent houses in Jacobean England. The grounds were designed by Capability Brown, though not without disagreements, as the information boards point out. The parterre and organic kitchen gardens have been restored.

                        <strong>Thursday, 2nd November: Day 4 - Trip to London to visit the National Gallery and to go to see English National Opera at the London Coliseum</strong><br><br>
                        A busy day today as it was off to London on the train to see the National Gallery and to go and see <a href ="https://www.eno.org/whats-on/la-traviata/" target = "_blank" title = "Click here to discover more about English National Opera's 'La Traviata' "><i>La Traviata</i></a> performed by the English National Opera at the London Colisseum. 
                        <br><br>
                        First, it was to the train station to catch the train into London. Then on to the National Gallery, which was extremely busy as it was half term week holiday for some of the schools. It was 
                        a good opportunity to see Turner's painting <i>'The Fighting Temeraire'</i> which is housed at the gallery, amongst many other well-known paintings. We appeared to be not the only ones to find the 
                        gallery very large and busy as we met another gentleman asking us if we knew the way out as he had been wandering around some time trying to find it!
                        <br><br>
                        Then it was onto our pre-theatre dinner at <a href = "https://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/london/covent-garden#/" target = "_blank" title = "Click here to find out more about Brown's at Covent Garden">Brown's Covent Garden</a>
                        before going on to the performance, which was very good.

                        It was a long journey for the return home today, but thankfully, we had the opportunity to break the journey en route  to have a very enjoyable lunch with some friends in Leicestershire
                        before arriving back home at 22.30.
