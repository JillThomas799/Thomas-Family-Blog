                        <strong>Monday, 30th October: Day 1 - From home to Market Bosworth, Warwickshire  Overnight stay in Market Bosworth.</strong><br><br>
                        The journey to Essex is long, so it was decided to break the journey midway in Market Bosworth in Warwickshire, where we had lived for a time many years ago.  This meant we could take the longer route via Alston and Middleton-in-Teesdale on the B6277, which is a very atmospheric drive (if you like wild countryside, that is) before joining the A1 at Scotch Corner.
                        We were staying the night at <a href = "https://www.bandbno3.co.uk/" target = "blank" title = "Click here to discover more about B&B No.3 at Market Bosworth">B&B at No.3</a>, Market Bosworth which is a lovely B and B in a Georgian-fronted building in the town centre and had booked an evening meal

                        <strong>Tuesday, 31st October: Day 2 - Breakfast in B and B in Market Bosworth, visit to Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre, drive to Essex.</strong><br><br>
                            After breakfast, it was time to review the weather (wetter than forecast...), put on our waterproofs, and head off on the 6 mile round walk via Sutton Cheney to the Battle of 
                            Bosworth Heritage Centre.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The route we were taking was through the bottom of the park in Market Bosworth on to the bridleway, which was a favourite route many years ago. However,
                            before long we realised we had taken the wrong track and with the assistance of a very kind local resident were able to discover that in the early 2000s a large number of new trees had been planted on the south side 
                            of the park which had now grown, so it looks quite different and less open now. It was impressively muddy after the rain and also it is very easy to get lost on these country footpaths, especially when misty (things I did remember from previously)! However, eventually we arrived safely 
                            and went in to view the heritage centre.
                            <br><br>
                            For those who are a little rusty with their history, the Battle of Bosworth took place on a field near to Market Bosworth in Warwickshire during the Wars of the Roses on the 22nd August 1485 
                            between the House of York, led by Richard III, and the House of Lancaster, led by Henry Tudor (soon to become Henry VII). In spite of their lesser numbers, the Lancastrians won and Richard III was killed.
