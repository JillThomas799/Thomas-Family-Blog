                    It was time to set out on the long-planned holiday to the hamlet of Vixe, near Badailhac 
                    in the Cantal region of the Auvergne in France today. Lennie was safely in the cattery where he had a luxury 
                    room. Bernard had set up a complicated watering system worthy of a Kew gardens award to try and protect the 
                    plants whilst we were away, so fingers crossed everything would be OK. Finally, we set off, first to pick up Elena 
                    and then down to Harry's in South Wales where we were to spend the night.

                    Left Harry's bright and early at 6am to catch the 12.20 'Le Shuttle' from Folkestone to Calais, an hour earlier
                    train than planned. Elena took us on to Le Shuttle. All progressed smoothly as even the M25 was relatively quiet (of a fashion). Then, there was a 136 mile drive 
                    on the other side to Neufchatel en Bray, where we stayed in a very pleasant Logis Hotel, <a href = "https://www.logishotels.com/en/hotel/logis-hotel-les-airelles-460" target="_blank">Logis Hôtel-Restaurant Les Airelles</a> 
                    2 Passage Michu. 76270 NEUFCHATEL EN BRAY.The room had a balcony and it was right by the centre of town. Dinner was great
                    and seemed popular with the local residents. Mackerel to start, Harry and Bernard had beef for the main, Elena and Jill had salmon, followed by the cheese course and 
                    then all apart from Bernard (who had a desert with a madeline base topped with lemon mousse and strawberries) had pear and chocolate desert.

                   The good news was that we managed to find a boulangerie open in Neufchatel en Bray so lunch was sorted. It was a very long drive today, broken up to some extent by listening to some of the back episodes of 'Rest is Politics' 
                   and a rather 'interesting' detour to Lidl on the edge of an industrial estate in Buchelay, Ile de France. However finally, at about 18.45, we successfully arrived in Vixe at our accommodation.

                   The journey had been a very long one the past few days so it was a rest day today, exploring the gite and going into Vic sur Cère to check out and acquire some food supplies. A boulangerie and patisserie were located opposite the Intermarché in Vic sur Cère. We acquired quite a few items of the local produce to try and support
                   local farmers. Today it was also time to check out the swimming pool.

                   Today the weather was more mixed with some rain so we took the opportunity to drive down into Vic sur Cère and visited the 
                   tourist information office (l'Office du tourisme) and the local twice weekly market. The lady in the tourist office was extremely helpful,
                   explaining in detail how the walks in the area could be identified and located using the Cirkwi app or website and how the way-marking system worked.
                   This information was to prove invaluable subsequently during our stay.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Down at the market we learnt the procedure for attending the local market and discovered the boulangerie in the centre of Vic sur Cère 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   In the afternoon, we familiarized ourselves with the hamlet of Vixe by going on a shortish circular walk through the countryside around the village.

                    <br>
                   Following the very long drive, via South Wales, from England, it was generally agreed that further long drives would be minimised for some days,
                   so, armed with the very helpful information from the tourist office (Office du tourisme) in Vic sur Cère and with the Cirkwi app safely downloaded,
                   some intermediate walks of 2-4 hours in the vicinity were located. It was decided to explore Raulhac, a nearby village crossed by the Goul valley and to undertake the intermediate, yellow way-marked <a href="https://www.cirkwi.com/fr/circuit/95089-du-rocher-de-la-mule-a-las-clauzades" target="_blank" title="Click here for of walk Rocher de la Mule a Lasclauzades">Rocher de la Mule a Las Clauzades walk </a>

                    <strong style="color:white;"> Ascent of Puy Mary: </strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A request had come in from the family for some high level walks. On the 16th September 2012 Jill and Bernard had climbed the 1806 metres Peyre Arse summit (adjacent to Puy Mary) in the Massif Central in the Cantal 
                    and really enjoyed the walk. They had not on that occasion climbed the summit of Puy Mary as it was deemed even then to be too busy. 
                    However, this time it was agree by all that Puy Mary summit would be a good walk. Puy Mary is number 37 of the <a href="https://www.puymary.fr/le-puy-mary-grand-site-de-france/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about the Grand Sites de France">Grand Sites de France</a>.
                    On the outward journey we took the route from Vic sur Cère to St Jacques des Blats, then turning off the main road to climb over to Mandailles (where the enticing sight of chicken roasting over an outdoor spit 
                    almost led to a stop being required). However, we pushed on to reach the parking at Pas de Peyrol.
                    <br>
                    It was a busy walk and also very steep as it requires a rapid ascent over a short distance. Elena and Harry of course made it to the top
                    first. However, the views on the way up, from the summit and on the way down were spectacular.

                        <br>
                      In 2009, the family visited Pailherols on a cross country skiing holiday and stayed at <a href="https://www.auberge-des-montagnes.com/" target="_blank" title="Click here to open L'Auberge des Montagnes website">L'Auberge des Montagnes</a>.
                      Ever since, Bernard had been keen to return in the Summer to undertake some of the local walks in the pasture meadows, when the wild flowers were in bloom. Therefore, the <a href="file:///C:/Users/JillT/OneDrive/Documents/Walks/cirkwi_Pailherols-Ma-Montagne-a-Pailherols-fr-94270.pdf" target="_blank" title="Click here to find our more about 'Ma Montagne' walk, Pailherols">'Ma Montagne' walk</a> was a must during the times we were here and a day with good 
                      weather forecast was chosen. This walk, at the end of the week won the favourite walk category of the holiday. It was interesting to compare the photos of then and now.
                      Much seems to have been done to promote tourism in Pailherols and there is now a trail of sculptures which forms part of the walk.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                   Our AirBNB host had suggested to us the walk to the <a href="https://www.cirkwi.com/fr/circuit/274222-de-lasmolineries-a-faillitoux-les-secrets-de-la-cascade" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about the walk to the Cascade de Faillitoux">Cascade de Faillitoux</a>, near Thiezac so, as the forecast for the morning weather was good,
                   we decided to set off on the walk. There is a relatively straightforward route from parking further up the valley, above the village of Lasmolinieres,
                   but on consulting the Cirkwi app, there was a slighter longer, yellow-marked route, which it was finally opted we should take.

                   The Cascade de Faillitoux has a drop of 45 metres and arose during the formation of the Massif Central, the mountain range which covers much of central France.
                   At 1010 metres, it is quite unusual for the Cantal region. The waterfall crosses a lava flow which has created basaltic organs at the bottom of the waterfall.

                    <br>
                    The Chateau de Pesteils is a castle of medieval origin built on a rocky promontory on the north bank of the river Cère. Overlooking Polminhac, it was a stronghold designed 
                    to defend the valley. It has been gradually expanded over the centuries.Some scenes from Jean Cocteau's 'Love Eternal' were filmed at the Castle.The castle includes a 13th century square keep.

                    <br>
                    We had been recommended the village of <a href="https://www.tourisme-aveyron.com/en/discover/conques/touristic-guide" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about Conques" >Conques</a> in the Aveyron département of the Occitania region as a possible place to visit,
                    as it is a very well-preserved medieval village set into a hillside and forms one of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (most beautiful villages of France).  Its <a href="https://www.tourisme-conques.fr/en/en-conques/st-foy-abbey-church" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about St Foy abbey, Conques"> St Foy abbey-church </a> it has been an important site of pilgramage as the relics of Sainte 
                    Foy, which were brought to Conques from Agen in 883, are housed there. Conques became one of the main stops on the Saint-Jacques de Compostelle pilgrimage route from Puy en Velay. We also took the opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.tourisme-conques.fr/en/en-conques/st-foy-abbey-church" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about St Foy abbey, Conques">abbey</a> although 
                    we were not able to visit the reliquary statue of Sainte Foy as the rooms were closed for lunch. None the less, we saw the <a href="https://www.tourisme-conques.fr/en/en-conques/the-tympanum" target=_blank title="Click here to find out more about the tympanum of the Last Judgement"> tympanum </a>of the Last Judgement (where a tympanum is the semi-circular or triangular decorative wall surface over an entrance, door or window, which is bounded by a lintel and an arch) as seen in the photo below.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                   Today was our last full day at the house in Vixe and for the next 3 days there would be a long drive home, first to Cardiff and then up North so we decided to go on a hike close to Vic sur Cère, the <a href="https://www.cirkwi.com/fr/circuit/86668-la-grotte-des-anglais-a-vic-sur-cere" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about the 'Grotte des Anglais@ walk">'Grotte des Anglais' walk.</a> 
                   This was a 6.26 km hike which was predicted to take 3 hours with 642 metres of ascent waymarked yellow, although it did only
                   become apparent later that this was actually also marked a highest difficulty walk (rating black, I would agree that this probably was a black rating walk)
                   The English grotto is a natural cave in the rock which served as shelter for the protestants/hugenots in the Wars of Religion.
                   The climb is very precipitous and for a large part along escarpment paths under cover of woods in the rock face. There is a spell 
                   on the pasture plateau at the tops which is easier walking in meadows and then back once again to walking and descending along escarpments 
                   towards the cave.

                   <strong style="color:white">Hike Rating: 6</strong> ( out of 10) due to the prolonged period walking along precipitous escarpments.

                        Left Badailhac bright and early at 7.20am, having said a final goodbye to our airBNB host. A quick visit then to the boulangerie opposite the Intermarché to
                        stock up on food for breakfast and for the journey and then we were on our way. Bernard drove the first section out to where we joined the A75 autoroute at Massiac and took us as far as the first stop 
                        at the Accueil motorway service station in the Haute Loire.Then Elena took over until near to Rouen. The ongoing route was via the A71 and then the A10 towards Paris, until we needed to turn off
                        and take the usual route through the outskirts of Rouen and of course, near to the centre of <a href="https://chartrescathedral.net/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about Chartres cathedral">Chartres</a> although we did get some phenomenal views of the cathedral at Chartres. The motorway journey was broken up
                        by recent weeks epsiodes of Rest is Politics, which had been saved up. There was, from some parties, regret over the lack of 'The World According to Humphrey' CDs, which had been so popular and our foreign holidays
                        in the past.
