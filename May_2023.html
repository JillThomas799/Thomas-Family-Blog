                    <section class = "news">It was Elena's final day at Droitwich today. Bernard had called to stay for several days on the way back from Penarth
                        to help clean and pack boxes and to take a forward load of some items. Very wisely, everyone agreed to opt out of the self-rental
                        option for a van and to use a small removal company instead. The removal team arrived to pack up the van, which they then kept overnight 
                        and set off at 5am to arrive in Penrith for 9.30am the following day. All went smoothly though and they had packed the van within an hour , which was amazing.

                        1hour 30 for the removal team to unload. Lots going on as one of the internet companies was also installing a router and several of the other 
                        trades people were tidying a few items, so a busy,busy day.
