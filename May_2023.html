                        to help clean and pack boxes and to take a forward load of some items. Very wisely, everyone agreed to opt out of the self-rental
                        option for a van and to use a small removal company instead. The removal team arrived to pack up the van, which they then kept overnight 
                        and set off at 5am to arrive in Penrith for 9.30am the following day. All went smoothly though and they had packed the van within an hour , which was amazing.

                        <article>Also, the garden is continuing to come into bloom with the gorse in particular splendid this year after heavy pruning last year.
                        We have also put in place a trellis against the wall as you ascend the steps to the terraces and have planted a climbing rose there in a pot.
                        Other improvements have been some refashioning of the border to the left of the steps where 2 buddleia plants and a photinia for winter colour have been
                        added to the bush rose, dianthus and blue and white campanula plants already in that border.</article>
