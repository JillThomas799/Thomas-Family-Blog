                        <br>
                    Harry and Elena arrived from Cardiff today, Elena returning from her week's holiday with Harry down there and Harry home to Cumbria 
                    for the first time since Easter. Lennie had been forewarned and was hanging around the garden in (sort of...)
                    anticipation...or so we like to think. Harry brought the first good weather for a month and it was a lovely evening so a barbecue in the garden was planned
                    and everyone had a great time. Bernard has been busy cutting back the beech hedge, which is an annual task, so there were good views over the tarn (hence the ladder in the background).

                        Bernard had been given an unused waffle-maker by his dad which brought back memories of our 2017 inter-railing trip when
                        we stayed in a hotel in Stockholm, Sweden and at breakfasts there was a waffle-maker people could use. Bernard got so good
                        at it that some of the other guests thought he was a member of staff and he ended up helping those who were struggling by making their waffles for them!!! Needless
                        to say, the waffles proved very popular.

                           A very warm spell of weather at last, which we had been waiting for all through August. So it was time to open the bifold doors and enjoy the 
                           outdoors. On Tuesday evening we drove down to see Elena in her new house as Harry had never been inside and took the opportunity to go out for a walk and 
                           to the local pub. Bernard meanwhile is yet again adding to our excess kitchen gadgetry by also bringing back a toastie-
                           maker from his parents which he has been trialing with at least an aim to make things slightly healthier by using reduced fat cheese and brown bread!
