                    Set off at 9.20am for Wales, with the bikes safely in tow, the plan being to do some cycling whilst we were away. Elena was safely back at Farlam with the most important job 
                    of minding Lennie (who on this occasion was to be spared from having to go and stay in Snuggles cattery). Both Google maps and the sat nav advised the quickest and shortest route to be the above.
                    We decided to test whether this would be true....

                It was off to Harry's today for the first of the 2 days we would be spending there (1hr 15 minute drive via the M4). The plan was to go out for lunch, and as it was a lovely day, 
                to visit <a href="https://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/enjoying/Coast-and-Countryside/cosmeston-lakes-country-park/Cosmeston-Lakes-Country-Park.aspx" tab="_blank" title="Click here to find more about Cosmeston Lakes and Medieval Village" >Cosmeston Lakes and Medieval Village</a> in the afternoon, which is owned by Vale of Glamorgan Council . 
                Whilst very busy at Cosmeston Lakes and Medieval Village, once you get away from the main areas and walkways, it is more extensive than if first appears, extending over 100 hectares of land and water, and it is easy to see why it is a haven for wildlife and how some areas are designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.The medieval village 
                is set in 1350 and is a living history museum aiming to try and recreate 14th century Welsh peasant life in the Late Middle Ages, using reconstruction of the buildings and actors. After a busy afternoon walking round the Lakes and medieval village,
                it was time for a visit to the café and then home to the flat for harry to enjoy one of Steve Wilson's famous pies from the local butcher in Cumbria.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Gower Peninsula in Glamorgan has long been a destination we have wished to visit but, because it is such a long drive from the North of England, we had never 
                    got round to going. This time, we determined, would be different and the first day which had decent weather forecast, we set off promptly for Rhossili village
                    where there is a large National Trust car park next to the beach. The drive over to the Gower Peninsula was winding and the roads fairly busy. 
                    However, there were some interesting livestock 'traffic-control' measures en route as can be seen in the photos below.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   As the Swansea Council reported in their <a href="https://www.swansea.gov.uk/RhossiliTop50?lang=en" target=""_blank">September 2023 press release </a>Rhossili Bay  on Gower peninsula is one of only two UK beaches to feature in a <a href="https://www.enjoytravel.com/en/travel-news/fabulous-beaches/the-50-best-beaches-in-the-world" target="_blank">Big 7 Travel list</a> of the planet's 50 must-see beaches.
                   The beach is popular with surfers, of which there were a number on the day we were there. As it was low tide the walk along the beach was straightforward and we were able to go right up to the remains of the <a href="https://heritagerecords.nationaltrust.org.uk/HBSMR/MonRecord.aspx?uid=MNA135055" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about the Helvetia shipwreck">Helvetia  shipwreck</a>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Half-way along the beach, by Hillend Camp site we turned inland and climbed the grass path up the hillside, joining the Rhossili Down's ridge near 'Burnt Mound', one of several prehistoric burial sites visible from the path. Then 
                   returned along the ridge, before dropping back down into Rhossili village and out towards Worm's Head.

                      There was a challenging section on the main A road down into Pontardawe to join the cycle route but after that, it was a traffic-free route all the way.There were however a number of pedestrians and forestry workers cutting trees etc, so care was needed, particularly on the narrow stretches where the cycle path was sandwiched between the canal-edge on one side and a drop down to a river on the other...!

                            <br>
                    Today we went to visit Caerphilly Castle which was built in 1268 by the marcher <i>Lord Gilbert de Clare</i> due to his fears and concerns about the increasing power of the then Prince of Wales 
                    <i>Llywelyn ap Gruffudd</i>. It was the largest castle in Wales, second only to Windsor Castle in all of Britain and was intended both as a fortress of great strength but also a symbol of lordship and power.
                    It covered a total of 30 acres and consisted of massive walls, towers and gatehouses and is an early example of the concentric (walls within walls) 
                    principle of defence.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After Llywelyn died, it was transformed into a palatial home with a hunting park and northern lake. It was subsequently passed to  Hugh Despenser (a favourite of Edward II), who revamped the great hall ornately.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When we visited, the central area of the castle was closed to access as development works were taking place in the Great Hall, central courtyard and some ground floor areas of the inner ward.
                            However it was permitted to look through, so we could see into these areas, including the Great Hall, and we did get a free guide book as a result! We also had full access to the famous leaning tower, which was very good.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Then it was time for <a href="https://www.visitcaerphilly.com/en/coffi-vista-caerphilly/" target="_blank">Coffi Vista</a>, the coffee shop across from the castle, for coffees.

There is a limited amount of free, on-street parking behind the castle but this was full. So we ended up on Morrison's car park for 3 hours and bought some shopping there. </li>

                            <br>
                    Today we decided to have a day out in Cardiff city centre, traveling by train from Neath station. So it was a 
                    prompt start in order to be down at the station to catch the 9.35am train into Cardiff Central, a 42 minute journey. First to John Lewis in St David's Dewi Sant
                    to look for clothes and have a coffee in the café, which is very pleasant and spacious. Then it was on with the shopping, however Cardiff city centre is a very large shopping area ...and we got 
                    very lost.... (we calculated by the end of the day, we had walked over 5 miles!)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                    Soon it was lunch and into Pizza Express for Pizza Florentine and dough balls (Bernard) and melanzane parmigiana (Jill). Then in the 
                    afternoon, it was up to the <a href="https://museum.wales/cardiff/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about the National Museum, Cardiff">National Museum</a> to explore the upper 
                    level art gallery which has some really interesting and well-known works of art including <i>Renoir's 'La Parisienne' 1874, 
                    Meng's 'Richard Wilson' c.1752, Cima de Conegliano's 'Virgin and Child' c.1500</i> amongst others.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                    Then it was time to return to the station and head back to Neath.

                        <strong style="color:white;"> Trip to Mumbles and Mumbles Head in the morning and Pontneddfechan in the afternoon: </strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Mumbles is a popular fishing village which marks the start of the Gower peninsula, and has been on our 'to be visited' list for sometime.
                        The weather forecast was <i>not good</i> , but there seemed to be a spell of dry weather we could use, so off we set...
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Dry weather greeted us at the Mumbles but even so, the first stop was <a href="http://www.verdis-cafe.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find more about Verdi's café, Mumbles">Verdi's café </a> and ice cream parlour for coffees. 
                       (P.s. they are also famous for their ice creams and have very gorgeous-looking italian cakes). Following this, it was up to <a href ="https://www.mumbles-pier.co.uk/about" target="_blank" title="Click here to find more about Mumbles pier">Mumbles pier</a> , RNLI station, Lighthouse and Mumbles Head.
                       It was here we could see the rescue helicopter winching a member of their team down towards the riptide off the head, seemingly in a practice manoeuvre (see video below).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then back along the combined cycle/pedestrian walkway towards Mumbles village, and had we kept going, eventually to Swansea Marina.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the afternoon, we headed inland to Pontneddfechan to see the waterfalls which are said to be spectacular after it has been raining. However, it was raining so 
                        hard even the sheep were miserable. So we went with the back up plan, and together with many others, ended up in the Angel Inn at Pontneddfechan, which is a fantastic,
                        tradtitional Welsh pub...
