        <section class = "news"><strong color="white">Outdoor Theatre production of Shakespeare's'Comedy of Errors' by the Pantaloons Theatre Company</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
        Went to see the outdoor production of Shakespeare's 'Comedy of Errors' by the <a href="https://thepantaloons.co.uk/" title="Click here to find more about the Pantaloons Theatre Company" target="blank" >Pantaloons theatre Company</a> in the evening at Talkin Tarn between 19.00 and 21.00. In spite 
        of the thunderstorm and the <i>pouring</i> rain which started an hour before the performance, from the time the performance started it was fine <i>(yeh!)</i>
        and we all had a brilliant time. It was a superb production and great fun. A number of the other spectators were clearly 'old-hands' at these performances,
        which are held annually during the Summer months, and had brought plenty alcohol, which the actors, hilariously, ad-libbed into the production.
        Even better for many people, the tarn cafe was open.

        Thankfully, it was warm and the view of the tarn was lovely as the sun started to set.

    <section class ="news">However, as the performance started, the rain stopped and it was fine <i>(apart from a couple of minutes of breakthrough rain)</i>. It was our first attendance
    at one of these productions and we were not sure whether we would like it as Shakespearean plays can be difficult to follow and engage with.
    However, the Pantaloons company, of whom the artistic director is <a href="https://thepantaloons.co.uk/about-us/" title="Click here to read more about Stephen Purcell" target="_blank">Stephen Purcell</a> and the co-artistic director/producer <a href="https://thepantaloons.co.uk/about-us/" title="CLick here to find out more about Mark Hayward" target="_blank">Mark Hayward </a>
    put on a fantastic, understandable and engaging performance using additional songs, dialogue, props and some clever audience participation as a means of clarification and audience engagement.
    It seemed to us that this is likely to have been how touring actors performed in Shakespeare's time. It certainly seemed more authentic and most importantly 
    more interesting and therefore enjoyable.  </section>
