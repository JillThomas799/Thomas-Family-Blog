        <section class = "news"><strong color="white">Outdoor Theatre production of Shakespeare's 'Comedy of Errors' by the Pantaloons Theatre Company</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
        Went to see the outdoor production of Shakespeare's 'Comedy of Errors' by the <a href="https://thepantaloons.co.uk/" title="Click here to find more about the Pantaloons Theatre Company" target="blank" >Pantaloons theatre Company</a> in the evening at the tarn between 19.00 and 21.00. In spite 
        of the thunderstorm and the <i>pouring</i> rain which started an hour before the performance, from the time the performance started it was fine <i>(yeh!)</i>
        and we all had a brilliant time. It was a superb production and great fun. A number of the other spectators were clearly 'old-hands' at these performances,
        which are held annually during the Summer months, and had brought plenty alcohol, which the actors, hilariously, ad-libbed into the production.
        Even better for many people, the tarn cafe was open.

        Thankfully, it was warm and the view of the tarn was lovely as the sun started to set.

    <section class ="news">However, as the performance started, the rain stopped and it was fine <i>(apart from a couple of minutes of breakthrough rain)</i>. It was our first attendance
    at one of these productions and we were not sure whether we would like it as Shakespearean plays can be difficult to follow and engage with.
    However, the Pantaloons company, of whom the artistic director is <a href="https://thepantaloons.co.uk/about-us/" title="Click here to read more about Stephen Purcell" target="_blank">Stephen Purcell</a> and the co-artistic director/producer <a href="https://thepantaloons.co.uk/about-us/" title="CLick here to find out more about Mark Hayward" target="_blank">Mark Hayward </a>
    put on a fantastic, understandable and engaging performance using additional songs, dialogue, props and some clever audience participation as a means of clarification and audience engagement.
    It seemed to us that this is likely to have been how touring actors performed in Shakespeare's time. It certainly seemed more authentic and most importantly 
    more interesting and therefore enjoyable.  </section>

        <section class = "news"><strong color="white">Test-run of the new bike trailer</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
       Today, it was decided to have a test-run locally of the new bicycle trailer with the bicycles attached prior to going anywhere further afield. The plan was to take both cars with the driver 
       in the rear vehicle (Jill) watching the vehicle carrying the bicycle trailer with  the bicycles attached in front (Bernard driving) to ensure they were secure. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Unfortunately, one of the electrical connectors worked loose 
       and trailed on the floor causing wear, so back home to order a replacement! The good news was that the car and bikes were well-able to negotiate the narrow country 
       lanes and the bikes were very securely held.
       <br>
       <br>
        So the bike ride on the Solway Firth was postponed for a few days and replaced with one of our favourite bike rides locally, with a stop at our local
       pub en route. One of the highlights of this bicycle ride was when we were riding down the hill towards the pub and we had to come to a grinding halt as the road was filled with multiple pheasants and their young wandering to and fro!

                <br>
          It had been very poor weather in August so far, limiting opportunity to have a barbecue. However, the forecast for today was much better,
          so Elena came over to join us for a barbecue. Lennie joined in on the action, but of course, as demonstrated in the video below.

                                <li><strong style="color:white;">Route:</strong> Enjoyable walk on clearly made tracks covering the circuit of Bolam Lakes, past East Shaftoe Hall and on to Shaftoe Crags, passing the sites of several old Iron Age settlements, before returning via Shaftoe Grange to Bolam lake for drinks and ice creams at the café. </li>

                    <br>
                    <br>
             We went to see the <a href="https://www.cumbriacrafts.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find more about the Annual Craftsmen at the Priory Exhibition">annual Craftsmen at the priory Exhibition</a> at <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lanercost-priory/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about Lanercost Priory">Lanercost Priory</a> with Elena,  which was very interesting. 
             It is held every year in August in the Dacre Hall at Lanercost Priory, this year from the 2nd to the 29th August 2023. There was, amongst other things, photographic art, glass jewellery, art and print making, watercolour, textiles and ceramics, designer knitwear, decorative painting, wood carving and furniture, ceramics, woodcraft and painting.  We then followed this with lunch at the priory tea rooms where 
             the food is always good. Elena decided to try out the pizzeria which had just opened, so a very enjoyable outing. 
               <br>
               <br>
               English Heritage (who run the site) describe on their website how <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lanercost-priory/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out more about Lanercost Priory">Lanercost Priory</a>was itself founded in 1169. It was home to a community of Augustinian canons and later to a branch of the Dacre family. In the period 1306-1307, the Priory formed the home of the sick King Edward I for 5 months. The Priory has a very interesting history and is well worth a visit.
               The priory was attacked frequently during the long Anglo-Scottish wars.

                            Went for a walk up the road which borders Peat Fell and the King's Forest of Geltsdale to the left and then dropped down into the neighbouring village and back. It was beautifully quiet and the first blackberries of the season were ready
                            so we managed to get a good helping. Blackberry picking was also helpful as there is a moderate incline up to the highest point so there were lots of opportunities 
                            for a rest en route!

                                As the weather was not suitable for the high fells, we decided to visit Barnard Castle for the first time. After a pleasant coffee stop in <i>The Artisan Bakehouse and Café</i>, we took the opportunity
                                to visit <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/barnard-castle/?utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=barnard%20castle" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Barnard Castle">Barnard Castle</a> which is managed by English Heritage.
                                It was a very interesting visit and we learnt form the information provided by English Heritage that the castle and town is named after another Bernard, Bernard de Balliol, who as Guy de Balliol's nephew, had succeeded him  by 1133.
                                We then undertook the walk below, by the River Tees and along to <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/egglestone-abbey/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Egglestone Abbey">Egglestone Abbey</a>.

                                  Elena went down to see Harry in South Wales for the week, the first visit she had been able to make since moving into her new house. They had opportunity, as it was the Bank holiday weekend, to drive 
                                  over for a trip to the Gower Peninsula on the Sunday and to undertake the Oxwich and Port-Eynon walk (8 miles), including of course the mandatory stop at a pub for lunch in the middle,
                                  after surviving the part of the walk now nicknamed 'The Jungle'! <br><br>
                                  There was also opportunity during the week for the mandatory walks on the pier and along the front, ice creams and of course, a stop at the 
                                  cake stop to replenish energy levels.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Harry returned with Elena back up to Cumbria for 2 weeks, which was great as we have not all been back at home in Cumbria together since Easter.
